# Algorithmic-Trading

Goal: develop a robust model that attempts to accurately forecast returns for a sample of 50 securities comprising the SSE 50 index. 

The problem assumes that at the beginning of trading, one has $1,000,000 which one can invest in varying amounts in any stock in our sample. 
Each buy/sell transaction incurs a transaction cost of 0.065% times the share price at time-period t. The objective is to maximize profits through simulating trades for securities from day 505 to day 756.
